1. Cleaning the Sources
If you did not use a separate object directory:
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-arago-linux-gnueabi- ARCH=arm distclean
If you used 'O=am335x' as your object directory:

2. remove separate object directories
rm -rf ./am335x

3. Building into a separate object directory with the "O=" parameter to make is strongly recommended.
make O=am335x CROSS_COMPILE=arm-arago-linux-gnueabi- ARCH=arm  am335x_evm

This will generate two binaries in the am335x directory, MLO and u-boot.img along with other intermediate binaries that may be needed in some cases.
