XMMS2 Ruby client tutorials

This directory contains sample Ruby programs to help you learn about what's
involved in writing an XMMS2 client. The Ruby files provided are well-commented
to explain the steps involved.

You should follow the tutorials in order, even if you are planning on writing
an asynchronous client, since the synchronous clients cover important concepts
such as value retrieval and error handling.

=== Running ===
To run a tutorial, run 'ruby tutX.rb' where 'X' is a tutorial number.

=== Tutorial Descriptions ===
==== Synchronous Tutorials ====
tut1:
Will show how to connect to the XMMS2 server and issue a basic command.

tut2:
How to do simple value retrieval. In this case, the currently playing medialib
ID is retrieved from the server.

tut3:
How to retrieve data from the medialib and dealing with PropDicts. This example
involves fetching the artist, title, and bitrate of the currently playing song
in XMMS2.

tut4:
How to retrieve the current playlist from the server and use the concepts from
tut3 to print a user-friendly playlist based on mediainfo.

==== Asynchronous Tutorials ====
The following tutorials make use of the GLib mainloop, so make sure you have
Ruby-GLib2 and xmmsclient_glib installed on your system.

tut5:
Connect an asynchronous client to the GLib mainloop and receive a signal.
